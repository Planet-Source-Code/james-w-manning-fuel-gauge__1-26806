### Description

This control is just an image of a dashboard fuel gauge with a needle pointing to the percentage done. It's very simple and can be modified to use other images. It has the typical min, max, value properties along with a property for showing the value label. The source is not commented much, but it's mostly self explanatory. I hope you like it, and modify it to suite your needs. PLEASE VOTE, I'd like to continue making more gauges and switches, so inspire me!
